Version: 1.0

Description: If a fixed effect model is applied to data involving large-scale providers, 
   the default glm function will be unsuitable since the computational burden of inverting 
   the Fisher information matrix becomes significantly high. This software package serves 
   as an implementation of the SerBIN method proposed by Wu et al. (2022), addressing and 
   mitigating the computational challenges associated with such large-scale provider data.
