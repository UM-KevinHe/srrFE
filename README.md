# GLM Model with Provider as Fixed Effects

The `srrFE` software package is designed to implement the SerBIN method proposed by Wu et al. (2022) (doi:10.1002/sim.9387), specifically tailored to address the computational challenges inherent in large-scale provider data.  Additionally, the package is equipped with functions designed to estimate standardized ratios and rates and conduct hypothesis testing.
