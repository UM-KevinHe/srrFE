Title: GLM Model with Provider as Fixed Effects
Version: 1.0
Date: 2023-12-14

Description: If a fixed effect model is applied to data involving 
   large-scale providers, the default glm function in R utilizes 
   the Newton-Raphson and Fisher scoring methods for updating objective 
   functions. Consequently, the computational burden of inverting the Fisher 
   information matrix becomes significantly high. This software package serves 
   as an implementation of the SerBIN method proposed by Wu et al. (2022) 
   <doi:10.1002/sim.9387>, addressing and mitigating the computational 
   challenges associated with such large-scale provider data.
